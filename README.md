# Calculator

This has been my process of programming a calculator while learning Python 3 as a starting programming language.

calculator1.py was my first ever attempt at just programming the basic calculations of a calculator without any error checking. 
It did what it was meant to do but crashed at unsuspected inputs. 
Using what I knew at the time; variables, if, elif, else and basic operations. 

calculator2.py was programmed a day or two after calculator1.py. I compacted the code using a while loop. Everything else I kept the same. 

calculator3.py was prohrammed after a couple of weeks. I learned a few new things and got stuck in tutorial hell for a bit. 
I implemented try/except to this version of the could so that it can still run even with unsuspected inputs. 
On a basic level, this code runs great but there is no GUI.
