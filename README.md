# Calculator

This has been my process of learning Python 3 as a starting programming language.

calculator1.py was my first ever attempt at just programming the basic calculations of a calculator without any error checking. 
It did what it was meant to do but crashed at unsuspected inputs. 
Using what I knew at the time; variables, if, elif, else and basic operations. 

calculator2.py was programmed a day or two after calculator1.py. I compacted the code using a while loop. Everything else I kept the same.
